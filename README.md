# Banking Survey Analysis 

MULTI-BANKING BEHAVIOR: ASSESSING THE INFLUENCE OF BANKING APP QUALITY AND OTHER FACTORS üè¶

Welcome to the **Multi-Banking Behavior** project!  
This project explores the increasing trend of consumers using **multiple banks**, identifying whether **mobile banking app quality** or **other factors** (like services, products, and security) are the main drivers.

---

## Project Overview

In an evolving financial landscape, many users now operate accounts with more than one bank. While the rise of digital banking plays a role, this study investigates a wider range of influences ‚Äî including financial products, service quality, and personal preferences.

---

## Objective

1. Compare the impact of **mobile app quality** vs. **non-app factors** on multi-banking behavior.
2. Assess if better mobile app experience drives switching to secondary banks.
3. Identify non-app factors like **risk diversification**, **customer service**, and **recommendations**.
4. Explore potential improvements (e.g. fee elimination, better apps) to increase single-bank retention.

## Conceptual Framework

- **Dependent Variable**: Multi-Banking Behavior (use of ‚â•2 banks)
- **Independent Variables**:
  - üü¶ *Banking App Quality*: User experience, features, security
  - üü® *Risk Diversification*: Spreading financial risk
  - üüß *Customer Service Quality*: Responsiveness, complaint resolution
  - üü© *Product Superiority*: Specialized accounts, offers, interest rates
  - üü• *Family/Relational Influence*: Joint accounts, family suggestions
  - üü™ *Ease of Mobility*: ATM/branch access, digital onboarding

## Key Research Questions

- **F1**: How does app quality affect multi-banking behavior?
- **F2**: Does fear of fraud or risk drive people to spread accounts?
- **F3**: Does poor service cause users to open secondary accounts?
- **F4**: Are specialized products a motivation to bank elsewhere?
- **F5**: Do family or relational ties result in multi-banking?
- **F6**: How much does convenience and mobility influence choice?

This section highlights the main questions used to assess what drives multi-banking behavior.
